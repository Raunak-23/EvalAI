      "question_number": 1,
      "marks_awarded": 9.0,
      "max_marks": 10.0,
      "justification": "The student correctly identified all the actors in the NIST Cloud Computing Reference Architecture based on the scenario. The roles of Cloud Consumer, Provider, Broker, Auditor, and Carrier are well-defined and mapped appropriately to the companies mentioned. The answer demonstrates a strong conceptual understanding of the framework. A minor point was deducted for a slightly imprecise definition of the Cloud Carrier's role."

    {
      "question_number": 2,
      "marks_awarded": 10.0,
      "max_marks": 10.0,
      "justification": "The student correctly identified the Hybrid Cloud as the most appropriate deployment model. The justification is excellent, clearly explaining how the public cloud component addresses the need for a quick launch and scalability, while the private cloud component ensures data privacy and security for sensitive health records. The advantages listed are directly relevant to the scenario."

    {
      "question_number": 3,
      "marks_awarded": 10.0,
      "max_marks": 10.0,
      "justification": "The student correctly recommended the Software as a Service (SaaS) model. The justification is sound, highlighting that SaaS provides ready-to-use applications (video conferencing, content creation) without the need for the institution to manage underlying infrastructure, thus meeting the 'ease of implementation' requirement. The explanation of the model and its advantages is accurate and complete."

      "question_number": 4,
      "marks_awarded": 3.0,
      "max_marks": 10.0,
      "justification": "The student was able to list several types of virtualization (Desktop, Server, Storage, etc.). However, the elaborations provided are either overly simplistic, vague, or conceptually incorrect (e.g., Network virtualization). Furthermore, the question's requirement to illustrate each type with a diagram was not fulfilled. The answer shows only a superficial familiarity with the topic."

    {
      "question_number": 5,
      "marks_awarded": 2.0,
      "max_marks": 10.0,
      "justification": "The answer to both sub-parts is largely incorrect. For part (i), the student correctly sorted the tasks for SJF but failed to calculate the total waiting time; the calculation shown is irrelevant. For part (ii), the student did not demonstrate an understanding of the iterative MIN-MIN algorithm, made errors in identifying minimum execution times, and did not determine the final allocation or overall execution time. Partial marks are given only for correctly sorting tasks in (i) and setting up the problem in (ii)."
