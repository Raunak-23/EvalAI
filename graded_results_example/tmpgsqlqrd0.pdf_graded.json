      "question_number": 2,
      "marks_awarded": 10.0,
      "max_marks": 10.0,
      "justification": "Correctly identified Hybrid Cloud as the most appropriate model and provided a comprehensive, well-reasoned justification addressing all scenario requirements (scalability, privacy, security, resources) with a relevant diagram."

      "question_number": 3,
      "marks_awarded": 10.0,
      "max_marks": 10.0,
      "justification": "Correctly identified SaaS as the most suitable service model, providing strong, relevant justifications aligned with the institution's functional needs and ease of implementation. Included a good comparative analysis with PaaS."

      "question_number": 4,
      "marks_awarded": 9.0,
      "max_marks": 10.0,
      "justification": "Elaborated well on System-level and Process-level virtualization with accurate diagrams. Also covered CPU and Memory virtualization effectively. I/O virtualization explanation was slightly less detailed, particularly for 'Direct' type."

      "marks_awarded": 3.0,
      "max_marks": 5.0,
      "justification": "For part (i), the Shortest Job First (SJF) principle was correctly applied for task sorting and assignment. However, there were arithmetic errors in calculating the total waiting time and average waiting time."
